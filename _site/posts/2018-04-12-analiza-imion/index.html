<p>Przetwarzając dane tekstowe można zetknąć się z problemem duplikatów przybliżonych. Każdemu na pewno przydarzyło się zrobić literówkę wprowadzając dane do jakiegoś formularza. Formularz może zawierać także pytanie o dane adresowe i na przykład ulicę 3 maja można zapisać na wiele sposobów:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 maja</li>
<li>trzeciego maja</li>
<li>3-go maja</li>
</ul>
<p>Podobnych przykładów można mnożyć, niemniej rezultat jest zawsze ten sam - jedna informacja i wiele jej wariantów.</p>
<h1 id="miary-podobieństwa">Miary podobieństwa</h1>
<p>W takiej sytuacji można skorzystać z pewnych miar podobieństwa tekstów (ang. fuzzy matching), które w R oprogramowane są w pakiecie <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringdist/index.html">stringdist</a>.</p>
<p>Najczęściej wykorzystywane algorytmy to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>odległość Levenshteina</strong> - odległość to liczba kroków wymaganych do przekształcenia jednego ciągu znaków w drugi. Działania jakie można wykonywać to wstawienie nowego znaku, usunięcie znaku lub zamianę znaku na nowy znak.</li>
<li><strong>odległość Damerau-Levenshteina</strong> - podobnie jak odległość Levenshteina, ale wprowadza działanie polegające na zamianie miejscami sąsiadujących znaków.</li>
<li><strong>najdłuższy wspólny podłańcuch</strong> (ang. longest common substring) - znajduje najdłuższy ciąg elementów leżących obok siebie w obu ciągach, natomiast odległość to liczba niesparowanych znaków.</li>
<li><strong>odległość Jaro</strong> - średnia z odsetka wspólnych znaków w pierwszym ciągu, odsetka wspólnych znaków w drugim ciągu oraz odsetka wspólnych znaków nie wymagających transpozycji. Przyjmuje wartości od 0 do 1, gdzie 0 to teksty identyczne, a 1 zupełnie różne.</li>
<li><strong>odległość Jaro-Winklera</strong> - zwiększenie podobieństwa ciągów, które według odległości Jaro są do siebie podobne.</li>
</ul>
<p>Na podstawie wyżej opisanych algorytmów można stwierdzić, że im mniejsza wartość danej odległości tym ciągi tekstowe będą do siebie bardziej podobne. Pakiet <code>stringdist</code> zawiera implementację jeszcze kilku miar, niemniej w tym poście skupiłem się na tych najbardziej popularnych.</p>
<h1 id="analiza-imion-męskich-w-2015-roku">Analiza imion męskich w 2015 roku</h1>
<p>Z racji tego, że nie dysponuję bazą zawierającą takie nieuporządkowane dane tekstowe to wykorzystamy statystyki dotyczące najczęściej nadawanych imion dzieciom dostępne na stronach <a href="https://www.gov.pl/cyfryzacja/dodatkowe-materialy">Ministerstwa Cyfryzacji</a>. Wiemy przecież, że niektóre imiona występują w kilku wariantach np. Angelika i Andżelika, więc spróbujemy je znaleźć.</p>
<p>W pierwszej kolejności wczytuję pakiety oraz dane. Pakiet <a href="https://github.com/mattflor/chorddiag">chorddiag</a> przyda nam się do wizualizacji uzyskanych wyników na wykresie strunowym.</p>

<p>Poniżej znajduje się gotowa funkcja, która zwraca zbiór z parami porównywanych tekstów i odległościami pomiędzy nimi oraz macierz, którą można przedstawić na wykresie strunowym.</p>
<p>Funkcja przyjmuje trzy argumenty:</p>
<ul>
<li>dane - wektor tekstów, które zostaną porównane ze sobą parami,</li>
<li>metoda - identyfikator metody z pakietu <code>stringdist</code>,</li>
<li>granica - przyjęty poziom podobieństwa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rezultatem działania funkcji są dwa obiekty:</p>
<ul>
<li>zbior - zawiera pary porównywalnych tekstów oraz wybraną odległość pomiędzy nimi,</li>
<li>macierz - macierz zawierająca wartości poniżej przyjętej granicy.</li>

<p>Macierz odległości dla podobnych imion męskich w 2015 roku miała rozmiar 124 x 124, natomiast imiona kobiece w 2017 roku znajdują się w macierzy wielkości 686 na 686. W związku z tym przedstawienie tych danych na wykresie strunowym czyni ten wykres mało czytelnym. Wobec tego pozostaje analiza wyłącznie w oparciu o dane liczbowe.</p>

<h1 id="podsumowanie">Podsumowanie</h1>
<p>Wykorzystane miary odległości pomiędzy tekstami różnią się między sobą jeśli chodzi o główną ideę, stąd trudno wskazać najlepszą z nich. Każda pozwala na identyfikację najbardziej zbliżonych tekstów, ale ze względu na różne kryteria. W praktyce warto zastosować kilka miar i ocenić zaproponowane obserwacje.</p>
<p>Z zastosowaniem opisanych metryk można analizować duże zbiory danych, niemniej w takim przypadku wizualizacja takich danych z wykorzystaniem wykresu strunowego staje się problematyczna i należałoby się skupić wyłącznie na analizie liczbowej bądź poszukać alternatywnych sposobów wizualizacji takich danych.</p>
